In this project, I gained hands-on experience in developing my first practical application, familiarizing myself with the fundamentals and principles of CRUD operations. I utilized essential packages such as Verta, Fortify Auth, SweetAlert2, and implemented various models including discount codes, blogs, products, categories, etc. This project proved to be a valuable learning experience for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed the process.
